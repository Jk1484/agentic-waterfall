# The Agentic Waterfall: How the AI Industry Is Regressing Software Development

**By Muhammadali Nazarov** — [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nazarov33/)

## What This Is

A structural analysis of why autonomous AI agents force a regression from Agile to Waterfall methodology — and why this makes development slower, not faster.

## Core Argument

Code created with General Intelligence in the loop = reviewed code.
Code created without GI in the loop = vibe code.

Every async agent workflow is either:
- **Option A:** Accept without human review → vibe code
- **Option B:** Add human review after creation → Waterfall → slower than sync pair-programming

There is no Option C.

The full argument is formalized as an inequality:

> **Process 2 (Async) = Process 1 (Sync) + Formalization Δ + Context Reload + Feedback Latency + Tooling Δ**

Each term is strictly positive. The inequality holds by construction.

## Key Findings
- Async agents force Waterfall by structural necessity — and Waterfall is strictly slower than Agile + sync AI
- Every improvement to async tooling converges back toward sync development
- The only way to make async faster is to remove human review — producing enterprise-scale vibe code
- The "Product Builder" is a developer under a different name — in the Agentic Waterfall
- The industry is destroying the junior-to-senior pipeline it depends on — for a workflow that's strictly slower
